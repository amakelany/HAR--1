With a large volume of smartwatches and phones being manufactured, there is a huge amount of data generated by them. In fact, smartwatches have various sensors that would track activities of users. With the aid of machine learning and deep learning, human activity could be predicted. In addition, mobile phones are using machine learning to detect the chances of users driving a car or not.

In this project, we are going to be working with machine learning and deep learning algorithms that would predict the activity performed by users based on the tracking data. You can open the IPYTHON notebook to get started. Thanks! 

## Directions to run the Ipython notebook 

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
2. Once "Git" is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to download this repository.  
3. If you have successfully installed Git, you'll get an option called "Gitbash Here" when you right-click on a particular location. 
4. Once the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then paste the link of the repository. 
5. The link of the repository can be found when you click on "Code" (Green button) and then, there would be a html link just below. Therefore, the command to download a particular repository should be "Git clone html" where the html is replaced by the link to this repository. 
6. Once downloaded, you might use the jupyter notebook to run the .ipynb files or other navigators to open this file.

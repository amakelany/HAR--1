# Human Activity Recognition Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches

With a large volume of smartwatches and phones being manufactured, there is a huge amount of data generated by them. In fact, smartwatches have various sensors that would track activities of users. With the aid of machine learning and deep learning, human activity could be predicted. In addition, mobile phones are using machine learning to detect the chances of users driving a car or not.

In this project, we are going to be working with machine learning and deep learning algorithms that would predict the activity performed by users based on the tracking data. You can open the IPYTHON notebook to get started. Thanks!

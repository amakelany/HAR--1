# ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Human Activity Recognition Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches

With a large volume of smartwatches and phones being manufactured, there is a huge amount of data generated by them. In fact, smartwatches have various sensors that would track activities of users. With the aid of machine learning and deep learning, human activity could be predicted. In addition, mobile phones are using machine learning to detect the chances of users driving a car or not.

In this project, we are going to be working with machine learning and deep learning algorithms that would predict the activity performed by users based on the tracking data. You can open the IPYTHON notebook to get started. Thanks! 

## Directions to run the Ipython notebook 

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
2. Once the Git is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to add the files or the repository. 
3. You'll have to click on "Gitbash here" that would be opened when you right click on a particular location. 
4. One the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then copy the clipboard file that is present when you click on Code in Github. The link must be pasted and run so that the files would be downloaded at the location of interest. 
5. Later, you'll need to use Anaconda Prompt and add "Jupyter notebook" in the prompt. 
6. This would open the jupyter notebook that could be used to run and load the .ipynb files respectively. Therefore, you would be able to run the project at hand.
